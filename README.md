Public Health Started It All: Public Health barriers ignited my love for data informed decisions:

Healthcare Access and Costs
  - Many older adults struggle to afford healthcare. Medicare has limits, and out-of-pocket costs for medications or long-term care can be high.  
  - Social workers help navigate healthcare systems, connect clients to Medicaid or community health programs, and educate them about Medicare benefits.  

Mental Health Issues 
  - Depression, anxiety, and dementia are common among older adults, worsened by isolation or loss of loved ones. Stigma may prevent seeking help.  
  - Social workers provide counseling, connect clients to mental health services, run support groups, and train caregivers to recognize symptoms like dementia.  

Elder Abuse and Neglect  
  - Older adults may experience physical, emotional, or financial abuse and neglect, especially those reliant on caregivers.  
  - Social workers identify and report abuse, educate families about elder rights, and work with Adult Protective Services (APS) or law enforcement.  

Economic Insecurity
  - Many older adults live on fixed incomes, relying on Social Security, but rising costs and inadequate savings can lead to poverty.  
  - Social workers assist with financial aid programs like SNAP, housing subsidies, and utility assistance. They also guide budgeting and resource management.  

Social Isolation and Loneliness
  - Mobility issues, loss of loved ones, and relocation can cause isolation, leading to loneliness and poor mental health.  
  - Social workers connect clients to senior centers, social groups, and volunteer opportunities. They advocate for accessible transportation and technology training to maintain connections.  â€ƒ
